# Task 4.3 - Fix conflict (3)

## Discuss About Previous Task

After commit the change, your log will be like the follow:

```
* (HEAD -> feature2) Task 4.2
|
|
* Task 4.1
|
|
* (master, feature1) Task 3
|
|
*  Task 2
|
|
*  Task 1
```

After checkout to "master" branch:

```
* (feature2) Task 4.2
|
|
* Task 4.1
|
|
* (HEAD -> master, feature1) Task 3
|
|
*  Task 2
|
|
*  Task 1
```

Note that you can't see "Task 4.1" and "Task 4.2" if you use the command `git log`.

Because `git log` only show all history until HEAD

If you want to see all branches, use `--all` option.
