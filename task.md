# Task 5 - Revert

## Discuss About Previous Task

After commit change to "master" branch, your log will be like the follow:

```
* (HEAD -> master) Task 4.3
|
| * (feature2) Task 4.2
| |
| * Task 4.1
|/
* (feature1) Task 3
|
|
*  Task 2
|
|
*  Task 1
```

Because you commit a change to "master" branch, the history has two branches.

After merge and commit, your log will be like the follow:

```
* (HEAD -> master) Merge branch 'feature2'
|\
| * (feature2) Task 4.2
| |
| * Task 4.1
* | Task 4.3
|/
* (feature1) Task 3
|
|
*  Task 2
|
|
*  Task 1
```

It will generate "Merge branch 'feature2'" automatically.


## Description
