# Task 4.1 - Fix conflict (1)

## Discuss About Previous Task

After this task, your log will be like the follow:

```
* (HEAD -> feature1) Task 3
|
|
*  Task 2
|
|
* (master) Task 1
```

Note that "Task 2" and "Task 3" is located "feature1" branch. "Task 1" is located "master" branch.

After merge, your log will be like the follow:

```
* (HEAD -> master, feature1) Task 3
|
|
*  Task 2
|
|
*  Task 1
```

Because "feature1" branch is based on "master" branch, the process of merging is just moving "master" to HEAD. And we call this process "fast forward".
